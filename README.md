# Mocha Test Problem

## Test Replication
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm test`

**Expected Result:** I would assume CDS would spin up a local server and run the tests against it. However, this is the output I receive
```commandline
; npm test

> cds-bug-5@1.0.0 test
> mocha



  0 passing (0ms)
